- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @REDAspie
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in working on Data Science and becoming a full-fledged Machine Learning specialist.
- ðŸŒ± I have a degree in Statistics, after which I decided to enroll to online courses on Data Science and further improve my programming skills on said topics.
-    Iâ€™m currently learning machine learning essentials and I am practising my new knowledge on standalone projects which can be found right here on GitHub!
-    The projects cover various fields as I find many topics interesting and/or important; however I quickly dive in and familiarize myself with anything i'm
-    about to work on.
